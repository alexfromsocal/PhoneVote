  Our company offers an intuitive, organized form of poll solutions<br>
  which does not depend on the audience having access to internet,<br>
  but instead just access to texting. This allows the pollster to<br>
  survey the opinion of its audience without cutting the opportunity<br>
  of people who cannot afford to have a data plan.

  Our product works with the help of Twilio's API, and will decrease<br>
  the barrier for the lower class and the higher class to actively<br>
  participate in important desitions. This product was initially<br>
  designed to be used in political scenarios where you want everyone<br>
  to actively participate, but has evolved to be more than that.<br>
  It can be used in scenarios as different as a college class or a<br>
  birthday party.

  <p>
  Our mission is to provide polling solutions for large and small<br>
  audiences, allowing everyone to participate in an anonimous way<br>
  without impacting the economy of anyone in the audience.
